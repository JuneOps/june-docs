Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) so teammates can access June with their existing Okta credentials.

## What you'll accomplish

- Configure Okta as your SSO provider
- Create an OIDC app integration in Okta
- Enable seamless authentication for your team
- Improve security with centralized identity management

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- **Okta Admin access** to create app integrations
- **June organization admin** permissions
- **Verified email domain** set up in June via **Settings > Email Domains**

<Info>
  June currently supports Okta as the SSO provider. Additional identity
  providers are coming soon.

## Step 1: Create the Okta app integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Okta Applications">
    1. Log into the Okta admin console.  
    2. Go to **Applications** > **Applications**.  
    3. Click **Create App Integration**.

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose OIDC Web Application">
    1. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect**.  
    2. Choose **Web Application**.  
    3. Click **Next**.

        alt="Okta create app integration dialog with OIDC Web Application selected"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      OIDC is recommended for web apps because it delivers OAuth 2.0 tokens with
      Single Sign-On support.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set general settings">
    - **App integration name**: Use something clear like "June SSO".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure redirect URIs">
    1. In **Sign-in redirect URIs**, enter `https://auth.juneops.com`.  
    2. Leave **Sign-out redirect URIs** empty (optional).

      />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      The redirect URI must match exactly `https://auth.juneops.com` for SSO to
      succeed.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set assignments">
    Choose who can use June through Okta:

    - Allow everyone in your organization.
    - Limit to selected groups for a safer pilot.
    - Skip now and assign later.

    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      Start with a small test group, then expand once validation succeeds.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and capture credentials">
    1. Click **Save** to create the app.  
    2. On the **General** tab, find **Client Credentials**.  
    3. Copy the **Client ID**.  
    4. Copy the **Client Secret** (click to reveal before copying).

        alt="Okta client credentials section showing Client ID and Client Secret"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Warning>
      Keep the Client Secret private—never share it or commit it to version
      control.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure SSO in June

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Authentication settings">
    1. Sign into the June dashboard.  
    2. Go to **Settings**.  
    3. Select **Authentication**.  
    4. Choose **Okta** under Available SSO Providers.

        alt="June settings page highlighting Okta as an SSO provider"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Okta details">
    1. **Issuer URL**: `https://[TENANT].okta.com` (replace `[TENANT]` with your
       Okta org name).  
    2. **Client ID**: Paste the value from Okta.  
    3. **Client Secret**: Paste the secret from Okta.

        src="/images/sso/okta/june_2.png"
        alt="June Okta configuration form with Issuer URL, Client ID, and Client Secret"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      In Okta, go to **Security** > **API** > **Authorization Servers** to copy
      the Issuer URL.
    </Tip>

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/sso/okta/okta_6.png"
        alt="Okta Authorization Servers page showing the Issuer URL"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Check>Confirm the Issuer URL exactly matches your Okta domain.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and verify">
    1. Click **Save** in June.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  After you save, Okta SSO can take a few minutes to finish initializing. Users
  may briefly see a login error during this window—wait a couple of minutes and
  try again.
</Note>

## Authentication flow

1. User enters their email on June and clicks **Continue**.  
2. June redirects the user to Okta for sign-in.  
3. After successful Okta authentication, the user is returned and logged into
   June automatically.

<Info>
  If the user already has an active Okta session, the redirect back to June
  completes without prompting for credentials.
</Info>

## User management

### First-time SSO users
- June creates the account automatically.  
- Profile data (name, email) comes from Okta.  

### Existing June users
- Existing accounts are linked by matching email.  
- Users are logged out and must sign in with Okta; prior login methods are no
  longer valid.  
- Permissions and data remain intact.

<Tip>
  Encourage everyone to switch to SSO, then disable password login once all
  users are confirmed.
</Tip>
