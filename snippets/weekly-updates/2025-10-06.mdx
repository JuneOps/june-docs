- **Import Asset Assignments**: Added the ability to import asset assignments, making it easier to bulk-update device ownership.
- **Improved Kandji Integration**: The agent can now fetch the last check-in date from Kandji, even if other MDM details aren't present.

- **General Security & Performance Updates**: Deployed routine updates to backend dependencies to ensure the platform remains secure and performant.

## Bug Fixes
