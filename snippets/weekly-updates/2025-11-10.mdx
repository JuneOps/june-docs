## Platform Security & June Bot

This week's updates include foundational work to make the June Bot more powerful, alongside important security fixes and platform upgrades.

## Product Improvements

- **June Bot Tool Registry**: Implemented a new "Tool Registry" for the June Bot. This foundational work will allow the bot to become more capable and perform a wider range of actions in the future.
- **Show Device Metadata**: You can now see custom device metadata fields, previously only stored in the backend, on the device details page.
- **Integration Capabilities**: The UI now shows an integration's capabilities even before it is connected.
- **Security & Performance Upgrades**:
  - Upgraded the platform to Rails 8.1 to improve performance and security.
  - Implemented new infrastructure for running regular security scans.

## Bug Fixes

- **Integration Disconnect**: Improved the workflow for disconnecting an integration to give you more control over what happens to your data.
- **Security Vulnerability**: Patched a security vulnerability in one of our frontend libraries.
- **UI Fix**: Hid the "copy" button on integration pages when there is no secret to copy.
