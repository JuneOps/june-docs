## June Bot Actions & UI Updates

This week's release is all about making June more automated and interactive. We've supercharged the June Bot to take action on your behalf and rolled out a general refresh of the application.

## Product Improvements

- **June Bot Actions**: The June Bot is no longer just for answering questions. It can now be used to perform actions, including:
  - **Bulk Device Status Updates**: You can now ask the bot to update the status of multiple devices at once. This action is also available in the UI.
  - **Update Device Status**: Change the status or physical condition of a specific device directly from chat.
- **Improved Bot & Tool UI**: We've rolled out a new, cleaner UI for approving actions suggested by the June Bot.
- **June Bot Engine Upgrade**: Re-architected the June Bot's backend, making it more powerful and able to support a wider range of tools.
- **General UI Refresh**: Shipped a refresh of the main June web application, including various styling updates.

## Bug Fixes

- **ITSM Tool Fix**: Fixed a bug where parameters for the "Create Ticket" tool were not being processed correctly.
- **Mobile Web UI**: Addressed an issue that caused jerky scrolling and visual instability on mobile devices.
- **Navigation & Chat Tweaks**: Made several minor adjustments to the main navigation and chat UI for a smoother experience.
