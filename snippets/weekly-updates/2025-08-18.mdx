Weâ€™ve launched advanced reporting capabilities to help you get more from your asset data. 
With powerful tools to slice, segment, and analyze your inventory, you can uncover trends, 
optimize procurement and lifecycle decisions, and see exactly how costs are distributed for 
smarter budget planning. Plus, you can generate executive-ready reports with flexible 
analysis that adapts to your needs. It's now available for all June users via 
the [Insights](https://app.juneops.com/insights) tab in the navigation bar.

**Comprehensive Metrics**
- **Count & Percentages**: See asset distribution across categories
- **Financial Analytics**: Track total cost, average cost, and book values
- **Age Analysis**: Monitor average asset age to inform refresh planning
- **Cost Per Employee**: Understand hardware investment by team member

**Flexible Data Slicing**
- **Primary Dimensions**: Group assets by Status, Product, Department, Platform, Asset Age, Warranty Status, and more
- **Secondary Segmentation**: Further break down each group by additional dimensions for deeper analysis

**Smart Grouping Examples**
