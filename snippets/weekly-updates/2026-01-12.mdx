## Tool-Level Approval Configuration

Configure approval requirements at the individual tool level, giving you granular control over which actions require human oversight. Enforce approvals on sensitive operations while letting routine tasks run automatically.

**What you get:**

- **Set approval policies per tool** — Require approval for high-impact actions like user deprovisioning while auto-approving read-only queries
- **Customize by risk level** — Match approval requirements to your organization's security and compliance needs
- **Streamline operations** — Reduce approval fatigue by only requiring sign-off where it matters

To configure approval policies, go to the **Settings** page and click on **Tools**. You can select either the **Manual** or **Autonomous** approval mode for any write action. All read actions happen in the **autonomous** mode.
