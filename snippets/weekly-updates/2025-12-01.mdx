## Identity Governance & Employee Insights

This week's release focuses on Okta managed applications, enhanced employee details, and improved rate limiting for identity provider integrations.

## Features

- **Okta Managed Applications**: Full support for tracking Okta-managed applications, groups, and entitlements within June with new database models and sync capabilities.
- **Employee Details Enhancement**: View which groups and applications each employee has access to, with source attribution for better identity governance insights.

## Product Improvements

- **Okta Rate Limiter**: Implemented cross-process adaptive rate limiting to respect Okta's conservative API limits.
- **Okta Token Caching**: Authentication now caches tokens in the database, preventing unnecessary token refreshes that hit rate limits.
- **UI Tweaks**: Fixed toast notifications and added avatar icons to member displays.

## Bug Fixes

- **Okta 429 Errors**: Fixed rate limit errors when fetching app assignment data from Okta.
