We're excited to launch our **[Firstbase integration](/integrations/firstbase)**, giving you complete visibility into device procurement and logistics directly within June. Query order status, track returns, and look up inventory—all through natural language.

**What you can do from with June AI chat:**

- **Track equipment orders** — Get order details including status, items, SKU info, and shipment tracking
- **Track returns** — View return status, retrieval method, and items being returned
- **Search by employee** — Find all orders and returns for a specific person
- **Inventory lookup** — Look up equipment by serial number to identify ownership
- **Natural language queries** — Ask June "What's the status of John's laptop order?" or "Show me pending returns"

## Bug Fixes

- **Slack Notification UI**: Fixed visual issues in the Slack notification interface.
- **UI Build Security**: Removed secrets from the UI build process for improved security.
