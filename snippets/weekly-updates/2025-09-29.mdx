## Device Management and Organizational Visibility

This week we focused on device management and organizational structure improvements. You can now track the physical condition of devices and manage departments and locations directly in June.

## Product Improvements

- **Physical Asset Condition Tracking**: Implemented a new system to track the physical condition of assets, including whether devices turn on, display status, and other attributes. This helps determine if devices are suitable for redeployment or need to be decommissioned.
- **Location and Department Management**: You can now create, update, and delete locations and departments. The new UI provides visibility into which employees and assets belong to each organizational unit.
- **Software Policy Contact Assignment**: Added the ability to assign employees as contacts for software policies, helping you designate a primary contact for renewals and contract management.
- **MDM Offboarding**: Devices will automatically be removed from your MDM when an employee's departure is processed in June.
- **Assign Locations to Devices**: You can now directly add and assign locations to your devices.

## Bug Fixes

- **Windows 11 Device Recognition**: Fixed an issue where the agent was not properly identifying Windows 11 devices, resolving incorrect device classification.
- **AI Agent Stability**: Addressed a bug that was causing the AI agent to malfunction.
- **Integration Settings**: Resolved an error that could occur in the backend when saving certain integration settings.
