## Device Management and Organizational Visibility

This week we focused on device management and organizational structure improvements. You can now assign devices to employees with automatic MDM sync, track physical device conditions, and manage departments and locations directly in June.

## Product Improvements

- **Device Assignment with MDM Sync**: Assign and unassign devices to employees directly in June with automatic synchronization to your MDM system. Assignment automatically updates location and department information, eliminating the need to manage data in multiple places.
- **Physical Asset Condition Tracking**: New asset condition monitoring system that tracks whether devices turn on, all ports and keys work, enclosure condition, display status, and other physical attributes. This helps determine if devices are suitable for redeployment or should be recycled/decommissioned, providing better refresh planning beyond just age and warranty data.
- **Department and Location Management**: New UI for managing departments and locations with visibility into which employees and assets belong to each organizational unit. This organizational data was previously not visible in the application.
- **Software Policy Contact Assignment**: Assign employees and their roles to software policies, allowing you to designate primary contacts for renewals and contract management.

## Bug Fixes

- **Windows 11 Device Recognition**: Fixed AI agent to properly identify Windows 11 devices by recognizing that OS version 10.0.22000 and above indicates Windows 11, resolving incorrect device classification.
