We're excited to launch our **[Jira integration](/integrations/jira)**, enabling June to act as an intelligent AI agent for your IT service desk. Connect Jira or Jira Service Management to automate ticket triage, provide asset-aware responses, and streamline your IT operations.

**What you can do:**

- **Trigger June via mentions or assignments** — Tag `@June AI` in a comment or assign a ticket to have June take action
- **AI-powered triage** — June reads tickets, identifies affected devices and users, and classifies priority
- **Asset-aware responses** — June includes device specs, warranty status, and health data when responding to tickets
- **Automated actions** — Create tickets, update status, add comments, and transition workflows
