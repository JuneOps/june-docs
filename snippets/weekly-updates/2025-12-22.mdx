We're excited to launch **[Okta SSO integration](/authentication/sso-setup)**, giving your team seamless, secure access to June using their existing Okta credentials. With OIDC-based authentication, your users get automatic provisioning and centralized identity management.

**What you get:**

- **Single sign-on** — Users authenticate with Okta and are automatically logged into June
- **Automatic user provisioning** — New users are created automatically on first login
- **Email-based account linking** — Existing June accounts are linked by matching email
- **Centralized identity management** — Manage access through Okta assignments and groups
- **Enhanced security** — Leverage Okta's MFA and security policies for June access

## Product Improvements

- **Notes for Assets & Employees**: Add notes to assets and employees with a new Notes & Docs tab on detail pages for better documentation and context.
- **Display Filters**: New display settings for Assets and Employees pages with filtering options for easier data management.
- **Refresh Calculation Overhaul**: Completely refactored refresh planning logic and UI for more accurate and helpful device refresh recommendations.
- **Dependency Upgrades**: Updated Rails dependencies for improved security and performance.

## Bug Fixes

- **Policy Text Spacing**: Corrected text spacing issues in the policy display interface.
