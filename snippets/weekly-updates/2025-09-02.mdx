We’ve enhanced June with intelligent data enrichment that automatically adds context to your IT inventory. 
These AI-powered capabilities remove the need for manual research and give you the information you need to 
make faster, better decisions. From real-time device valuations to plain-English software descriptions, 
June now delivers the insights you used to look up elsewhere.

**Automated Device Valuations**
- Apple devices now include automatic market value estimates based on current conditions and specifications.
- Get instant insights for budget planning, insurance reporting, and refresh cycle optimization.
- Eliminate manual price research and ensure accurate financial reporting across your entire Apple fleet.
- Coupled with data from Apple Business Manager, now plan depreciation and hardware spend across all of your Apple devices.

**Intelligent Software Context**
- June AI now generates clear, plain-English descriptions for every discovered application.
- Helps IT teams quickly understand purpose and functionality without hours of manual research.
- Surfaces context that makes software reviews, approvals, and renewals faster and more consistent.

## Product Improvements

- **Software Ownership Tracking**: Assign approvers and sponsors to software applications, making it easy to see who owns renewals and budgets.
- **Kandji Firewall Tracking**: Firewall status from Kandji-managed devices is now collected 
and applied against your compliance policies. This means June can fully evaluate 
firewall requirements for assets managed in Kandji, just like it already does for other MDM systems.
- **Recovery Key Status**: You can now see escrow status for each device directly on the compliance tab. 
This makes it easy to confirm whether recovery keys are properly escrowed in Jamf or Kandji, ensuring devices meet your encryption requirements.
- **Navigation**: Software and asset sections have been reorganized so you can find devices, apps, and policies faster.
- **Software policy analyzer updates**: When the analyzer updates a policy, June now highlights the exact change and shows the reasoning behind it. This gives you clear visibility into both what was changed and why.
- **Improved integration events**. Integration events now have a partial success status when the integration sync finishes with errors but still managed to sync some data.
- **Performance**: The employee page now loads 2× faster, making it quicker to view device assignments and employee details.

## Bug Fixes

- Removed unnecessary API calls that were causing rate limit errors causing the Jamf sync to fail.
- Fixed an issue where ABM data was being overridden with null values causing existing data to be cleared out.
- Fixed 429 rate-limit errors; you can now configure the integration using either a channel name or channel ID.
- Resolved an issue where compliance fields were not being pulled in correctly to display the current status of a device.
- Fixed a bug where mobile device activity was not being fetched from Jamf. The system was always calling the computer history endpoint; it now scopes correctly by device type.
