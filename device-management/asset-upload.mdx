## Tips for Success

### Before You Upload

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify locations exist">
    Location names must match existing locations in June exactly. Create any new locations before importing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check email formats">
    Ensure all employee emails are valid and properly formatted.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use consistent naming">
    Product names should be consistent across your CSV for proper grouping and reporting.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove duplicates">
    Each serial number should appear only once in your CSV file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Formatting Guidelines

<Card title="CSV Formatting Rules" icon="file-csv">
  - Save your file as **CSV (Comma Separated Values)**
  - Use **UTF-8 encoding** to support special characters
  - Dates should be in **YYYY-MM-DD** format (e.g., `2024-01-15`)
  - Currency values should be **numbers only** without symbols (e.g., `2499.00` not `$2,499.00`)
  - Leave cells **empty** for optional fields you don't have data for
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Location not found">
    The location name in your CSV doesn't match any existing location in June.
    
    **Solution:** Create the location in June before importing, or remove the location from your CSV.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplicate serial numbers">
    The same serial number appears multiple times in your file.
    
    **Solution:** Remove duplicate rows from your CSV, keeping only one entry per serial number.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Invalid email format">
    An employee email address is not in a valid format.
    
    **Solution:** Check for typos, extra spaces, or missing characters in email addresses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Date format errors">
    Purchase dates are not in the expected format.
