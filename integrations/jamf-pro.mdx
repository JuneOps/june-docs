## Data Synchronization

### What Gets Synced

|Data Type | Jamf Pro Source | June Destination | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **Device Identity** | Computer Name, Serial Number | Device Name, Asset Tag | Primary device identification |
| **Hardware Info** | Model, Processor, Memory, Storage | Hardware Specifications | Complete hardware inventory |
| **Software** | Operating System, Software Applications | System Info, App Inventory | OS version and installed apps |
| **User Assignment** | User and Location fields | Employee Assignment | Links devices to users |
| **Compliance** | Last Inventory, Check-in Status | Health Status | Device connectivity and compliance |
| **Department Data** | Device assignment to departments | Department and Location | Organizational groupings |
| **Purchase Data** | Purchase Date, Warranty Info, Cost Center, Asset Tag | Asset Purchase Date, Warranty Expiration, Department Cost Center, Physical Asset Tag | Purchase data for assets |

### Sync Process

1. **Initial Sync**: Complete inventory sync on first connection
2. **Incremental Updates**: We pull the latest data from Jamf Pro every day and also sync the data for individual devices that have been updated in the last 24 hours.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: June handles data conflicts automatically
4. **Error Handling**: Failed syncs are retried with exponential backoff
5. **Integration Health**: We monitor the health of the integration and alert you if there are any issues.

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Regular API credentials rotation**: Change API account credentials regularly
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to the API account
- **Monitor Access**: Review API access logs regularly
- **Secure Storage**: June encrypts the API credentials before storing them in our database.

### Performance
- **Optimal Sync Frequency**: Balance data freshness with server load
- **Smart Filtering**: Use device filters to reduce sync overhead
- **Off-Hours Syncing**: Schedule heavy syncs during low-usage periods
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch server performance during sync operations

### Maintenance
- **Regular Testing**: Periodically test the integration connection
- **Update Management**: Keep Jamf Pro and June integrations updated
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of custom configurations
- **Backup Configuration**: Document integration settings for disaster recovery
