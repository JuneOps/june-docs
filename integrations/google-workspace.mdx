<img src="/images/google_logo.png" alt="Google Workspace Integration" />

Connect your Google Workspace environment with June to enable secure API-based access to users, groups, and organizational data for automated employee data synchronization.

## What you'll accomplish
- Authorize June to access your Google Workspace data
- Enable automated identity and device data synchronization
- Set up comprehensive asset tracking and compliance monitoring

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration, ensure you have:
- Google Workspace Super Admin access
- June organization admin permissions

## Permissions and Data Access

June requests the following read-only permissions to provide comprehensive asset management and security insights:

| Scope | Access Type | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `admin.directory.user.readonly` | Read-only | Syncing user directory data: names, emails, status, org units, used for employee-device mapping and account visibility |
| `admin.directory.group.readonly` | Read-only | Fetching Google Groups and memberships to model teams, departments, and apply group-based policies |
| `admin.directory.resource.calendar.readonly` | Read-only | Accessing resource calendars, buildings, and equipment (e.g., meeting rooms) for inventory and usage insights |
| `admin.directory.device.chromeos.readonly` | Read-only | Syncing ChromeOS device inventory for asset tracking, device assignment, and compliance reporting |
| `admin.directory.device.mobile.readonly` | Read-only | Fetching managed mobile device data (iOS/Android) to track mobile assets and enforce security posture |
| `admin.reports.audit.readonly` | Read-only | Pulling audit logs (logins, admin actions, access attempts) for activity monitoring and anomaly detection |
| `admin.reports.usage.readonly` | Read-only | Retrieving user and service usage metrics (e.g., Gmail, Drive) to assess software adoption and identify inactive users |

<Note>
All permissions are read-only. June never modifies your Google Workspace data and only accesses the information necessary to provide asset management and security insights.

    4. Click **Allow** to grant June access to your Google Workspace data. 
    5. If you see a message saying "Access blocked: Authorization Error" or "admin_policy_enforced" error during OAuth flow, please follow the troubleshooting steps below to resolve the issue.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Integration Setup">
    1. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to June
    2. If the integration is successful, you should see a message saying "Integration connected successfully" and you should see the integration as connected.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    1. Click on the dropdown menu that has the status of the integration
    2. Click **Test Integration**

</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Service Account Management**: Regularly rotate service account keys
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary OAuth scopes and permissions
- **Access Monitoring**: Review Google Workspace audit logs regularly
- **Domain-Wide Delegation**: Limit delegation to necessary service accounts only

### User Management
- **Consistent Naming**: Use standard naming conventions for groups and organizational units
- **Automated Lifecycle**: Leverage Directory API for automated user provisioning
- **Department Alignment**: Align June access with organizational structure
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular access audits and cleanup

### Performance
- **Sync Optimization**: Configure appropriate sync frequencies for your needs
- **API Efficiency**: Use batch operations and pagination for large datasets
- **Rate Limiting**: Monitor and respect Google API quotas
- **Error Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for provisioning errors and failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth Authorization Blocked">
    **Symptoms**: "Access blocked: Authorization Error" or "admin_policy_enforced" error during OAuth flow
    
    **Solutions**:
    If your organization has strict third-party app policies, you'll need to explicitly trust June's OAuth application:
    
    1. In June, go to the Integrations page and select **Google Workspace**
    2. Click on the dropdown menu next to the integration status
    3. Click **Copy Client ID** to copy June's OAuth Client ID
    4. Go to [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com) and sign in as a Super Admin
    5. Navigate to **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**
    6. Under **API Controls**, click **Manage Third-Party App Access**
    7. Click **Add app > OAuth App Name or Client ID**
    8. Paste the June OAuth Client ID you copied from step 3
    9. Select **Trusted** as the access level
    10. Click **Configure** and save changes
    11. Return to June and retry the OAuth authorization flow
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Integration Test Failed">
    **Symptoms**: Integration shows as "Inactive" after OAuth authorization
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Ensure you authorized with a Google Workspace Super Admin account
    - Verify your organization allows third-party app access
    - Check if you have any conditional access policies blocking API access
    - Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration
    - Contact June support if the issue persists
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sync Problems">
    **Symptoms**: Users not syncing or outdated information
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the authorized admin account has access to all organizational units
    - Check if users are suspended or in organizational units with restricted access
    - Review Google Workspace audit logs for API access issues
    - Ensure users have the required attributes (email, name, etc.) populated
    - Try a manual sync to see if specific error messages appear
