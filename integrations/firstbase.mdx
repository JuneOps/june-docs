Connect your Firstbase environment with June to track equipment orders, returns, and inventory across your organization.

<Info>
The Firstbase integration is **read-only**. June can query order status, returns, and inventory but cannot create or modify records in Firstbase.

## What you'll accomplish

- Generate an API key in Firstbase
- Configure the June integration
- Understand available data and actions
- Track equipment orders and returns

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration, ensure you have:

- Firstbase admin access to generate an API key

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication failed - invalid or expired API key">
    **Symptoms**: Connection fails or shows authentication errors
    
    **Solutions**:
    - The API key may have been revoked in Firstbase
    - Generate a new API key in Firstbase settings
    - Update the API key in June's integration settings
    - Verify there are no extra spaces when pasting the key
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Order not found or Employee not found">
    **Symptoms**: June returns "not found" errors for specific records
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the ID is correct (UUIDs are case-sensitive)
    - The record may have been deleted in Firstbase
    - Check if you're using the correct identifier format
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Empty results when listing orders/returns">
    **Symptoms**: Queries return no results when you expect data
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Check your date filters—defaults to the last 30 days
    - Verify the `person_id` if filtering by employee
    - Confirm the employee has orders/returns in Firstbase
    - Try broadening your search criteria
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection timeout errors">
    **Symptoms**: Requests take too long and fail
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Firstbase API may be experiencing issues
    - Try again in a few minutes
    - Check Firstbase status page for outages
    - Contact June support if the issue persists
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management

- **Dedicated Keys**: Use a dedicated API key for June so it can be revoked independently if needed
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are encrypted at rest in June's secure storage
- **Regular Rotation**: Consider rotating API keys periodically (quarterly recommended)
- **Access Auditing**: Review API access logs in Firstbase regularly

### Data Access

- **Read-Only Access**: The Firstbase integration cannot create or modify orders—only read data
- **Minimal Scope**: June only accesses the data needed for equipment tracking
