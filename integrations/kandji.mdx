### Step 2: Configure Token Permissions

Ensure your API token has the following permissions:

#### Required Permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API Token">
    **Symptoms**: "Authentication failed" or "Invalid token" errors
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the API token was copied correctly
    - Ensure that the *Tenant Details* permission is enabled.
    - Check if the token has been revoked or expired
    - Ensure sufficient permissions were granted to the token
    - Test the connection by clicking the "Test Connection" button.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Insufficient Permissions">
    **Symptoms**: "Access denied" errors for specific operations
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Review token permissions in Kandji settings
    - Ensure all required permissions are enabled
    - Check if permissions were modified after token creation.
    - Edit the token permissions in Kandji and save.
    - Test the connection by clicking the "Test Connection" button.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Subdomain Issues">
    **Symptoms**: "Tenant not found" or connection errors
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the Kandji organization API URL is correct. You must enter the full URL https://subdomain.api.kandji.io
    - Check for typos in the subdomain field
    - Ensure the Kandji tenant is active and accessible
    - Test direct access to Kandji web interface
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Sync Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Devices">
    **Possible Causes**:
    - Devices not enrolled in Kandji
    - Devices haven't checked in recently
    - Insufficient permissions to access certain devices
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify device enrollment status in Kandji
    - Check last inventory date for missing devices
    - Confirm API permissions cover all required devices
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Outdated Information">
    **Possible Causes**:
    - Devices not checking in regularly
    - Sync frequency too low
    - Network issues preventing updates
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Increase sync frequency if needed
    - Force inventory update on devices by clicking on the "Sync Now" button in the integration page.
    - Check device connectivity and management status
    - Review sync logs for specific error messages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Problems">
    **Symptoms**: Slow syncs, timeouts, high resource usage
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Reduce sync frequency during peak hours
    - Monitor Kandji server performance during sync windows
    - You could be hitting the rate limit of the Kandji API. You could try to increase the sync frequency to reduce the number of devices that are synced.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Token Management**: Regularly rotate API tokens (quarterly recommended)
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to integration tokens
- **Access Monitoring**: Review API access logs in Kandji regularly
- **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely in June's encrypted storage

### Performance  
- **Optimal Sync Frequency**: Balance data freshness with API usage
- **Daily Sync**: We sync the data for all devices every day. You can manually sync the data by clicking the "Sync Now" button. However, we recommend leaving it on daily sync.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Kandji has a rate limit of 10,000 requests per hour per customer. If you have a large number of devices, you may need to stagger your syncs. However, we don't see people hitting this limit.

### Compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review integration permissions and access
- **Change Documentation**: Document any changes to integration configuration
- **Compliance Alerting**: Set up proactive alerts for compliance violations
- **Blueprint Alignment**: Ensure Kandji blueprints align with organizational policies
