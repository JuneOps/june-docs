- Set up automated sync preferences

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration, ensure you have:
- Kandji tenant with API access
- Admin or appropriate API permissions in Kandji
- June organization admin permissions
- Understanding of your Kandji device management setup

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Generate API Token in Kandji

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Kandji Settings">
    1. Log into your Kandji tenant
    2. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar
    3. Go to **Access** section
    4. Select **API Token**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Token">
    1. Click **Generate New Token**
    2. Enter a descriptive name: "June Integration Token"
    3. Set appropriate permissions (see permissions section below)
    4. Click **Generate**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy and Secure Token">
    1. **Immediately** copy the generated token
    2. Store it securely - you won't be able to view it again
    3. Note the creation date for future reference
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Token Permissions

Ensure your API token has the following permissions:

#### Required Permissions
- **Devices**: Read access to device inventory and details
- **Users**: Read access to user assignments  
- **Blueprints**: Read access to device blueprint configurations
- **Apps**: Read access to application inventory
- **Compliance**: Read access to device compliance status
- **Audit Logs**: Read access for troubleshooting

### Step 3: Configure June Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access June Integrations">
    1. Log into June
    2. Navigate to **Integrations > MDM Systems**
    3. Click **Add Integration**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Kandji">
    1. Choose "Kandji" from the available integrations
    2. Click **Configure** to start the setup wizard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Kandji Details">
    Provide the following information:
    - **Kandji Subdomain**: Your Kandji subdomain (e.g., `yourcompany` from `yourcompany.api.kandji.io`)
    - **API Token**: The token generated in Step 1
    - **Sync Interval**: How often June should sync with Kandji. Default is daily.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    1. Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup
    2. June will attempt to connect and retrieve sample data
    3. Resolve any authentication issues before proceeding
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Configure Sync Preferences

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Sync Frequency">
    Choose sync interval based on your environment:
    - **Every 15 minutes**: For dynamic environments with frequent changes
    - **Every 30 minutes**: Balanced approach (recommended)
    - **Hourly**: For stable environments with fewer device changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Data to Sync">
    Choose which device attributes to synchronize:
    - Device inventory and specifications
    - User assignments and locations
    - Blueprint assignments and compliance
    - Application inventory
    - Device health and status
    - Audit events
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Alerts">
    Set up notifications for:
    - Sync failures and connection issues
    - Compliance violations detected
    - New devices discovered
    - Integration performance issues
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Synchronization

### Kandji Data Mapping

    - Consider breaking large environments into segments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Token Management**: Regularly rotate API tokens (quarterly recommended)
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to integration tokens
- **Access Monitoring**: Review API access logs in Kandji regularly
- **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely in June's encrypted storage

### Performance  
- **Optimal Sync Frequency**: Balance data freshness with API usage
- **Daily Sync**: We sync the data for all devices every day. You can manually sync the data by clicking the "Sync Now" button. However, we recommend leaving it on daily sync.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Kandji has a rate limit of 10,000 requests per hour per customer. If you have a large number of devices, you may need to stagger your syncs. However, we don't see people hitting this limit.

### Compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review integration permissions and access
- **Change Documentation**: Document any changes to integration configuration
- **Compliance Alerting**: Set up proactive alerts for compliance violations
- **Blueprint Alignment**: Ensure Kandji blueprints align with organizational policies
