## API Authentication

ABM integration uses JWT-based authentication with ECDSA P-256 certificates for secure API access:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Method">
    - **Algorithm**: ES256 (ECDSA with SHA-256)
    - **Key Format**: PKCS#8 PEM format (.p8 files)
    - **Automatic Renewal**: Tokens are automatically renewed before expiration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security Features">
    - Private keys and tokens are encrypted at rest in June's database
    - All API communication uses TLS encryption
    - Keys can be rotated in ABM portal without downtime.
    - Only read only access to the ABM API is granted to June.
