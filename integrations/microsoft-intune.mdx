## Best Practices

### Security
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Consider using certificates instead of client secrets for enhanced security
- **Secret Rotation**: Regularly rotate client secrets before expiration
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary API permissions
- **Conditional Access**: Apply appropriate conditional access policies

### Performance
- **Smart Filtering**: Use device and user filters to optimize sync performance
- **Batch Processing**: Allow June to batch API requests for efficiency
- **Off-Peak Syncing**: Schedule intensive operations during low-usage periods
- **Monitor Throttling**: Watch for Microsoft Graph API rate limits

### Compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review app permissions and access
- **Change Management**: Document any changes to the integration configuration
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Set up alerts for compliance policy violations
- **Data Retention**: Understand data retention policies for synced information

## Microsoft Graph API Limits

Be aware of Microsoft Graph throttling limits:

| Resource Type | Throttle Limits | Best Practices |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Device queries** | 1000 requests/10 minutes | Use filtering and paging |
| **User queries** | 3000 requests/5 minutes | Batch requests when possible |
| **Application data** | 600 requests/20 seconds | Implement retry logic |

## Next Steps
