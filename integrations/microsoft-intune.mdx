Connect your Microsoft Intune environment with June for comprehensive device management across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.

## What you'll accomplish
- Register an Azure application for June
- Configure Microsoft Graph API permissions
- Set up the June integration
- Understand cross-platform device synchronization

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration, ensure you have:
- Microsoft Entra ID with Intune licensing
- Global Administrator or Intune Administrator role
- Azure app registration permissions
- June organization admin permissions

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Configure June Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access June Integrations">
    1. Log into June
    2. Navigate to **Integrations > MDM Systems**
    3. Click **Add Integration**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Microsoft Intune">
    1. Choose "Microsoft Entra" from available integrations
    2. Click **Connect** to start setup
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete OAuth Flow">
    1. Sign in with your Azure administrator account
    2. Grant consent for the requested permissions. 
    3. On success, youâ€™ll return to June with integration activated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Sync Settings

<Steps>
  
  <Step title="Set Sync Frequency">
    Choose sync interval based on your environment:
    - **Every day**: For most environments
    - **Every other day**: For environments with a large number of devices
    - **Every week**: For environments with infrequent changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Data Scope">
    Select what data to synchronize:
    - Sync all employees
    - Device inventory and specifications (always on)
    - Sync Software Applications
    - Device actions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Synchronization

### Supported Device Types

| Platform | Device Types | Key Data Synced |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Windows** | Desktops, Laptops, Tablets | Hardware specs, compliance status, installed apps |
| **macOS** | MacBooks, iMacs, Mac minis | System info, security settings, application inventory |
| **iOS/iPadOS** | iPhones, iPads | Device model, OS version, app compliance |
| **Android** | Phones, Tablets | Device info, work profile status, managed apps |

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Client Credentials">
    **Symptoms**: "Invalid client" or "Authentication failed" errors
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret are correct
    - Check if client secret has expired
    - Ensure app registration is in the correct tenant
    - Confirm admin consent was granted
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Insufficient Permissions">
    **Symptoms**: "Access denied" or "Forbidden" errors when syncing
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Review API permissions in Azure app registration
    - Ensure admin consent was granted for all permissions
    - Check if permissions were accidentally removed
    - Verify the user granting consent had sufficient privileges
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tenant Access Issues">
    **Symptoms**: "Tenant not found" or "Invalid tenant" errors
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Confirm Tenant ID is correct (check Azure portal)
    - Verify app registration exists in the correct tenant
    - Check if tenant has appropriate licensing
    - Ensure network connectivity to Azure endpoints
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Sync Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Devices">
    **Possible Causes**:
    - Devices not enrolled in Intune
    - Insufficient permissions to access device data
    - Device filtering excluding expected devices
    - Conditional access blocking access
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify device enrollment status in Intune portal
    - Check API permissions include all required scopes
    - Review device filters in June integration settings
    - Confirm devices meet sync criteria
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Outdated Device Information">
    **Possible Causes**:
    - Devices not syncing with Intune regularly
    - Long sync intervals in June
    - Network connectivity issues
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Force device sync in Intune portal
    - Reduce sync frequency in June
    - Check device connectivity and management status
    - Review Intune device compliance policies
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Issues">
    **Symptoms**: Slow syncs, API throttling, timeouts
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Implement device filtering to reduce data volume
    - Stagger sync schedules during off-peak hours
    - Monitor Microsoft Graph API throttling limits
    - Consider breaking large tenants into multiple integrations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Consider using certificates instead of client secrets for enhanced security
- **Secret Rotation**: Regularly rotate client secrets before expiration
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary API permissions
- **Conditional Access**: Apply appropriate conditional access policies

### Performance
- **Smart Filtering**: Use device and user filters to optimize sync performance
- **Batch Processing**: Allow June to batch API requests for efficiency
- **Off-Peak Syncing**: Schedule intensive operations during low-usage periods
- **Monitor Throttling**: Watch for Microsoft Graph API rate limits

### Compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review app permissions and access
- **Change Management**: Document any changes to the integration configuration
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Set up alerts for compliance policy violations
- **Data Retention**: Understand data retention policies for synced information

## Microsoft Graph API Limits

Be aware of Microsoft Graph throttling limits:

| Resource Type | Throttle Limits | Best Practices |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Device queries** | 1000 requests/10 minutes | Use filtering and paging |
| **User queries** | 3000 requests/5 minutes | Batch requests when possible |
| **Application data** | 600 requests/20 seconds | Implement retry logic |
