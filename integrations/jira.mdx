Connect your Jira environment with June to enable an intelligent AI agent that can triage, respond to, and manage tickets on your behalf.

<Info>
June does **not** sync or import issues from your Jira instance. Instead, June acts as an intelligent agent that can be triggered to work on specific tickets.
</Info>

## What you'll accomplish

- Create a service account in Atlassian Admin
- Generate OAuth 2.0 credentials for secure API access
- Configure the June integration
- Set up webhooks so June can respond to ticket events
- Learn how to trigger June to act on tickets

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration, ensure you have:

- Atlassian organization admin access
- Access to create service accounts in Atlassian Admin
- June organization admin permissions
- Understanding of which Jira projects you want to integrate

## How June Works with Jira

### Triggering June

There are two ways to have June act on a Jira ticket:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Mention June in a Comment" icon="at">
    Tag the June service account in a comment (e.g., `@June AI please triage this ticket`). June will read the ticket and respond.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Assign a Ticket to June" icon="user-check">
    Assign any ticket to the June service account. June will pick it up and take action based on your configured workflows.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Available Actions

Once triggered, June can perform the following actions on Jira tickets:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create ticket** | Create a new issue in any project with summary, description, issue type, priority, and assignee |
| **Get ticket** | Read ticket details including summary, description, status, priority, assignee, and comments |
| **Update description** | Modify the description/body of an existing ticket |
| **Add comment** | Post comments on tickets (supports internal/private comments for JSM) |
| **Transition ticket** | Change ticket status (e.g., Open → In Progress → Resolved) |
| **Assign to June** | Take ownership of a ticket |
| **Unassign ticket** | Remove the current assignee from a ticket |

### Example Use Cases

    4. Feel free to close or delete the ticket after testing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks notify June when tickets are created, updated, or commented on—allowing June to respond in real-time when triggered by mentions or assignments.

### Step 1: Get Your Webhook URL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Webhook Settings">
    1. In June, go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Jira**
    2. Under the **Webhooks** section, click **Register**
    3. Copy the generated **Webhook URL**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Webhook in Jira

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Jira System Settings">
    1. Go to your Jira instance
    2. Click the **Settings** gear icon at the top right corner of the page.
    3. Navigate to **System** → **Webhooks**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Webhook">
    1. Click **Create a webhook**
    2. Configure the following settings:
       - **Name**: `June Integration`
       - **URL**: Paste the webhook URL from Step 1
       - **Secret**: Generate a secure secret and save it for the next step.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Webhook Events">
    Choose which events should trigger the webhook:
    - `Issue created` - When new issues are created
    - `Issue updated` - When issues are modified
    - `Issue deleted` - When issues are deleted
    - `Comment created` - When comments are added
    - `Comment updated` - When comments are edited
    - `Comment deleted` - When comments are deleted
    
    <Tip>
    Use the **JQL Filter** field to limit which issues trigger webhooks. For example, `project = SUP` will only send webhooks for issues in the SUP project.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Webhook">
    Click **Create** to save the webhook configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Save Webhook Secret in June

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Webhook Setup">
    1. Return to June's Jira integration settings
    2. Enter the **Webhook Secret** you generated in Jira
    3. Click **Save**
    4. Your webhook is now active and will receive real-time updates
    
    <Check>
    Test by creating a ticket in Jira and mentioning the June service account in a comment. June should respond within a few moments.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

    - Check project workflow rules for assignment restrictions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="June's actions fail">
    **Possible Causes**:
    - Insufficient permissions for the action (e.g., transitioning tickets)
    - Workflow restrictions preventing the action
    - Required fields missing for the action
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Review service account permissions in the project
    - Check project workflow for transition requirements
    - Ensure any required custom fields are configured
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

- **Token Security**: OAuth 2.0 access tokens expire after 60 minutes and are automatically refreshed by June
- **Secret Storage**: Webhook secrets are encrypted at rest in June's secure storage
- **Unique Secrets**: Use a unique webhook secret for each integration
- **Regular Rotation**: Periodically rotate OAuth credentials (quarterly recommended)

### Access Control

- **Least Privilege**: Grant the service account only the permissions needed for integration
- **Project Scope**: Limit service account access to only the projects you need to integrate
- **Audit Logging**: Regularly review service account activity in Atlassian Admin

### Incident Response

- If you suspect a webhook URL has been compromised, regenerate it immediately in June
- If credentials may be compromised, revoke them in Atlassian Admin and create new ones
- Review Jira audit logs for any unauthorized access
