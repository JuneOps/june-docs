description: 'Connect your IT Service Management tools with June for AI-powered ticket handling and automation'
---

Connect June with your IT Service Management (ITSM) platform to enable an intelligent AI agent that can triage, respond to, and manage tickets on your behalf—with full access to your asset data.

<Info>
June does **not** sync or import tickets from your ITSM platform. Instead, June acts as an intelligent agent that responds when triggered by mentions or assignments.

## Common Integration Features

### How June Interacts with Tickets

June can read and act on tickets when triggered:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Read ticket details** | Access summary, description, status, priority, assignee, and comments |
| **Create tickets** | Create new issues with full details including custom fields |
| **Update tickets** | Modify description, priority, labels, and other fields |
| **Add comments** | Post public or internal comments (JSM supports private comments) |
| **Transition status** | Move tickets through workflow states |
| **Assign/Unassign** | Change ticket ownership |

### Triggering June

June responds to tickets through two primary methods:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mention in Comments">
    Tag the June service account in any comment (e.g., `@June AI please help with this`). June will read the ticket context and respond appropriately.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ticket Assignment">
    Assign a ticket directly to the June service account. June will pick up the ticket and take action based on your configured workflows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Webhook Events

Webhooks notify June when to take action:

| Event | Description | When June Acts |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Issue Created** | New ticket created | If assigned to June or configured for auto-triage |
| **Issue Updated** | Ticket modified | If June is mentioned or assigned |
| **Comment Added** | New comment posted | If June is mentioned in the comment |
| **Assignment Changed** | Ticket reassigned | If assigned to June |

## Use Cases

### Automated Ticket Triage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign to June">
    Configure your ITSM to automatically assign new tickets to June, or set up a triage queue where June reviews incoming requests.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Intelligent Classification">
    June reads the ticket content, identifies the requester's devices, and classifies the issue type, priority, and required expertise.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Route or Resolve">
    June either resolves simple requests directly (with relevant asset information) or routes complex issues to the right team with context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### AI-Assisted Support

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mention June for Help">
    When a technician needs help, they mention June in a comment to get AI-assisted analysis and suggestions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Asset-Aware Responses">
    June provides responses that include relevant device information—specs, warranty status, installed software, and health history.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Knowledge Integration">
    June references your documentation, past resolutions for similar issues, and known problems to suggest solutions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Proactive Device Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Warranty Checks">
    When handling hardware issues, June automatically checks warranty status and suggests repair, replacement, or warranty claim options.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Follow-up Tickets">
    June can create related tickets in other projects—for example, creating a procurement ticket when a device needs replacement.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Status Updates">
    June keeps tickets updated as it gathers information, transitions statuses, and logs actions taken.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Service Account Security**: Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Credential Rotation**: Rotate OAuth credentials periodically (quarterly recommended)
- **Webhook Secrets**: Use unique, strong secrets for webhook authentication
- **Access Auditing**: Regularly review service account activity and permissions

### Performance
- **Webhook Optimization**: Subscribe only to events where you want June to respond
- **Project Scoping**: Limit the service account to projects where June should operate
- **JQL Filters**: Use filters to control which tickets trigger webhooks
- **Action Limits**: Configure appropriate rate limits for June's actions

### Workflow Design
- **Clear Triggers**: Define when June should act vs. when humans should handle tickets
- **Escalation Paths**: Configure how June escalates complex issues to your team
- **Response Templates**: Customize June's response style to match your team's voice
- **Feedback Loop**: Review June's actions periodically to improve accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
    - Verify OAuth credentials haven't expired or been revoked
    - Confirm service account has access to required projects
    - Check that all required API scopes are granted
    - Test credentials using the platform's API explorer
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="June Not Responding">
    - Verify webhook is configured and enabled
    - Confirm you're using the correct service account username in mentions
    - Check service account has access to the project
    - Review webhook delivery logs for errors
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="June's Actions Failing">
    - Verify service account has sufficient permissions for the action
    - Check workflow rules don't block the action (e.g., required fields, transitions)
    - Review API rate limits haven't been exceeded
    - Confirm the action is valid for the ticket's current state
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Incorrect Asset Information">
    - Ensure asset data in June is up-to-date via MDM integrations
    - Verify user-device assignments are current in your identity provider
    - Check serial numbers and asset tags are correctly formatted
    - Review June's asset matching logic for false positives
  </Accordion>
