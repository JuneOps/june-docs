---

Connect June with your ITSM platform to enable an AI agent that can triage, respond to, and manage tickets—with full access to your asset, identity, and software application data.

<Info>
 Currently, June does **not** sync or import all your tickets from your ITSM platform. Instead, June acts as an intelligent agent that responds when triggered by mentions or assignments giving you full control on what you want June to work on.

## How It Works

### Triggering June

June responds to tickets through two methods:

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mention in comments** | Tag `@June AI` or June service account in any comment and June will read the ticket and respond |
| **Ticket assignment** | Assign a ticket to the June service account and June will take action |

### Available Actions

Once triggered, June can perform these actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Read ticket details** | Access summary, description, status, priority, assignee, and comments |
| **Create tickets** | Create new issues with full details including custom fields |
| **Update tickets** | Modify description, priority, labels, and other fields |
| **Add comments** | Post public or internal comments |
| **Transition status** | Move tickets through workflow states |
| **Assign/Unassign** | Change ticket ownership |

<Note>
June uses webhooks to receive real-time updates when tickets are created, updated, or commented on. See the platform-specific guide for webhook setup.
