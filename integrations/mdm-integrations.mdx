## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Choose Your MDM Platform

Select the MDM system you want to integrate:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mac Management">
    - **Jamf Pro**: Enterprise Mac management
    - **Kandji**: Modern Mac device management
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Cross-Platform Management">
    - **Microsoft Intune**: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android support
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Multiple Systems">
    - **Multi-MDM Setup**: Integrate multiple MDM platforms simultaneously
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Prepare Integration Requirements

Each MDM platform has specific requirements:

- **API Access**: Admin access to create API credentials
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure June can reach your MDM systems
- **Permissions**: Appropriate read/write permissions for device management
- **Testing Environment**: Recommended for initial setup and testing

### 3. Follow Platform-Specific Guide

Click on your MDM platform above to access detailed integration instructions including:
- Step-by-step setup process
- Required permissions and configurations
- Data synchronization details
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Common Integration Features

### Data Synchronization

All MDM integrations provide:

| Data Type | Description | Sync Frequency |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Device Inventory** | Hardware specs, serial numbers, models | Real-time |
| **User Assignments** | Device ownership and location | Real-time |
| **Compliance Status** | Policy adherence and health | Every 15-30 minutes |
| **Application Inventory** | Installed software and versions | Daily |
| **Configuration Data** | Profiles, policies, and settings | Real-time |

### Remote Device Actions

Supported actions vary by MDM platform:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Actions">
    - Restart device
    - Lock device
    - Locate device
    - Update inventory
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security Actions">
    - Remote wipe
    - Passcode reset
    - Lost mode activation
    - Certificate management
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Management Actions">
    - Install/remove applications
    - Deploy configuration profiles
    - Update device settings
    - Force policy updates
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal required permissions for API access
- **Credential Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and certificates
- **Secure Storage**: Store credentials securely in June's encrypted vault
- **Access Monitoring**: Review integration access logs regularly

### Performance
- **Sync Optimization**: Configure appropriate sync frequencies for your environment
- **Filtering**: Use device filters to reduce unnecessary data transfer
- **Peak Hours**: Schedule intensive operations during off-peak hours
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for integration health and performance

### Management
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of integration configurations
- **Testing**: Test integrations in non-production environments first
- **Change Management**: Plan and communicate integration changes
- **Backup**: Document settings for disaster recovery

## Integration Health Monitoring

### Key Metrics

Monitor these metrics for all MDM integrations:

- **Sync Success Rate**: Percentage of successful synchronizations
- **Data Freshness**: How recently device data was updated
- **API Response Times**: Performance of MDM API calls
- **Error Rates**: Frequency and types of integration errors

### Alerting

Set up alerts for:
- Integration failures or connection issues
- Sync delays or performance degradation
- API rate limiting or quota issues
- Data inconsistencies between systems

## Multi-MDM Environments

Many organizations use multiple MDM platforms:

### Common Scenarios
- **Platform-Specific**: Jamf for Mac, Intune for Windows
- **Departmental**: Different MDMs for different teams
- **Geographic**: Regional MDM preferences
- **Acquisition**: Inherited MDM systems from acquisitions

### Management Strategies
- **Clear Boundaries**: Define which MDM manages which devices
- **Consistent Policies**: Align security and compliance across platforms
- **Unified Reporting**: Use June for consolidated views and reporting
- **Avoid Overlap**: Prevent devices from being managed by multiple MDMs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
    - Verify API credentials are correct and haven't expired
    - Check if accounts have been disabled or permissions changed
    - Ensure network connectivity between June and MDM systems
    - Review firewall rules and IP allowlisting
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sync Problems">
    - Check device enrollment status in MDM systems
    - Verify API permissions include all required scopes
