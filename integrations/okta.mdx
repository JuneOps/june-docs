## Best Practices

### Security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required access to users
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically review user access and group memberships
- **MFA Enforcement**: Require multi-factor authentication for all users
- **Certificate Management**: Monitor SAML certificate expiration dates

### User Management
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for groups and roles
- **Automated Lifecycle**: Leverage SCIM for automated user provisioning/deprovisioning
- **Department Alignment**: Align June access with organizational structure
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular access audits and cleanup

### Performance
- **Group Optimization**: Use groups efficiently to minimize provisioning overhead
- **Batch Operations**: Leverage bulk operations for large user base changes
- **Sync Frequency**: Configure appropriate sync frequencies for your needs
- **Error Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for provisioning errors and failures
