## Smart Search

Use natural language to find exactly what you're looking for in your asset inventory.

### How It Works
Smart Search understands context and intent, allowing you to ask questions like:
- "Show me all MacBooks assigned to the engineering team"
- "Which devices are due for refresh this quarter?"
- "Find laptops with security compliance issues"
- "Show me assets purchased in 2023 over $2000"

### Search Examples

#### By Assignment
- "Devices assigned to John Smith"
- "All assets in the marketing department"
- "Unassigned devices in San Francisco office"

#### By Status and Condition
- "Devices due for refresh"
- "Assets with expired warranties"
- "Inactive devices older than 6 months"
- "Devices with compliance violations"

#### By Specifications
- "MacBook Pros with 16GB RAM"
- "Windows laptops purchased after January 2023"
- "Mobile devices running iOS 16 or newer"

#### By Cost and Budget
- "Assets costing more than $1500"
- "Devices purchased from Apple this year"
- "Assets with depreciation value under $500"

### Advanced Search Features

#### Smart Filters
The AI automatically suggests relevant filters based on your search:
- Device type refinements
- Date ranges
- Cost brackets
- Location filters

#### Search History

## AI Agents

Specialized AI agents handle specific aspects of asset management automatically.

### Asset Compliance Agent

**Purpose**: Monitors security and policy compliance across all devices

**What It Does**:
- Scans device configurations for security vulnerabilities
- Checks compliance with organizational policies
- Identifies devices with outdated security settings
- Monitors encryption and firewall status

**Sample Insights**:
- "24 devices detected with disabled firewalls requiring immediate attention"
- "3 laptops have full disk encryption disabled, creating security risk"
- "15 mobile devices need iOS security updates"

### Refresh Planning Agent

**Purpose**: Optimizes hardware refresh cycles and timing

**What It Does**:
- Analyzes device age, performance, and usage patterns
- Considers warranty status and failure rates
- Factors in budget constraints and procurement cycles
- Recommends optimal refresh timing and prioritization

**Sample Insights**:
- "42 laptops eligible for refresh - estimated budget impact $84,000"
- "Delaying refresh of engineering workstations by 6 months could save $15,000"
- "Recommend prioritizing sales team device refresh before Q4"

### Cost Optimization Agent

**Purpose**: Identifies opportunities to reduce IT spending

**What It Does**:
- Analyzes spending patterns and vendor relationships
- Identifies underutilized assets
- Recommends consolidation opportunities
- Suggests better purchasing strategies

**Sample Insights**:
- "12 unused tablets could be reassigned to reduce new purchases"
- "Bulk purchasing 50 laptops could save 15% vs. individual orders"
- "Consider leasing vs. purchasing for mobile devices based on usage patterns"

### Risk Assessment Agent

**Purpose**: Identifies and prioritizes IT risks

**What It Does**:
- Evaluates security vulnerabilities across the fleet
- Assesses compliance gaps and audit risks
- Monitors device lifecycle and failure risks
- Prioritizes risk mitigation actions

**Sample Insights**:
- "High risk: 8 executive devices not enrolled in MDM"
- "Medium risk: 25 devices approaching end-of-support OS versions"
- "Compliance risk: 5 devices missing required security software"

## Predictive Analytics

### Refresh Forecasting

The AI analyzes multiple factors to predict optimal refresh timing:

#### Factors Considered
- **Device Age**: Based on purchase date and expected lifecycle
- **Warranty Status**: Warranty expiration and support availability
- **Performance Metrics**: CPU usage, memory, storage capacity
- **Failure Rates**: Historical failure data for similar devices
- **Usage Patterns**: How intensively devices are used
- **Budget Cycles**: Organizational budget and procurement timing

#### Forecast Outputs
- **Recommended Refresh Date**: Optimal timing for device replacement
- **Cost Estimates**: Predicted replacement costs with confidence ranges
- **Risk Assessment**: Impact of delaying or accelerating refresh
- **Budget Impact**: Quarterly and annual budget implications

### Budget Predictions

AI-powered budget forecasting helps you plan IT spending:

#### Short-term Forecasts (1-3 months)
- Immediate refresh needs and costs
- Warranty expiration impact
- Emergency replacement requirements

#### Medium-term Forecasts (3-12 months)
- Planned refresh cycles
- Budget allocation by department
- Seasonal spending patterns

#### Long-term Forecasts (1-3 years)
- Strategic refresh planning
- Technology lifecycle transitions
- Growth-based asset requirements

### Compliance Predictions

The AI identifies future compliance risks:
- **OS End-of-Life**: Devices approaching unsupported OS versions
- **Certificate Expiration**: Security certificates needing renewal
- **Policy Changes**: Impact of new security policies
- **Audit Preparation**: Readiness for compliance audits
